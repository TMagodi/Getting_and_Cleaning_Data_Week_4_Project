Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo is Thato Magodi's submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project.It contains instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

The Dataset Used
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files Contained in the repo
CodeBook.md: A code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations that I performed to tidy and clean up the data.

Run_analysis.R : For showing howto perform data preparation and the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition i.e:

1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyData.txt is the result fo the preparation as outlined above.
